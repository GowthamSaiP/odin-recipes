        <ul>
            <li>Dal.</li>
            <li>Onions and Tomato.</li>
            <li>Vegetables - Mixed vegetables like <strong>cucumber, carrots, potatoes, pumpkin, drumsticks are used in sambar.</strong></li>
            <li>Sambar Powder.</li>
            <li>Tamarind.</li>
            <li>Salt and Jaggery.</li>
            <li>Tempering spices like <strong>mustard, cumin seeds, dry red chillies, asafoetida and curry leaves</strong> in <em>hot oil or ghee</em>.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>1. Preparation and Cooking Lentils</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Before we begin making sambar, it always helps to soak tamarind in water earlier. So soak 1 tablespoon tamarind in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the tamarind gets soft, then squeeze the tamarind in the water itself. Discard the strained tamarind and keep the tamarind pulp aside.</li>
            <li>Rinse ½ cup tuvar dal (100 grams) a couple of times in fresh and clean water. You can use a strainer to rinse the lentils.</li>
            <li>Drain all the water and add the dal in a 2 litre stovetop pressure cooker. Also add ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.</li>
            <li>Add 1.5 to 1.75 cups of water and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Cover and pressure cook dal for 7 to 8 whistles or 9 to 10 minutes on medium heat.</li>
            <li>When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and check the dal. The dal should be completely cooked and mushy.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>2. Cook Vegetables</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>When the dal is pressure cooking - rinse, peel and chop the vegetables. When making sambar, chop the vegetables which get cooked faster in large sizes like pumpkin, brinjals (small aubergines) okra, drumsticks etc.</li>
            <li>Take 1 to 1.5 cups chopped vegetables in a pan or pot. Also add 6 to 7 pearl onions or 1 small to medium onion (thickly sliced) and 1 small to medium tomato (quartered).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder and salt as per taste.</li>
            <li>Add 1.5 to 2 cups water and stir. Add enough water so that they cover the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Keep the pan on a stove top and begin to cook vegetables on a medium-low to medium heat. In between do check when the vegetables are cooking.</li>
            <li> Cook till the vegetables are almost done. Ensure that you don't overcook the vegetables.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>3. Make Sambar</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the prepared tamarind pulp to the cooked vegetables. If you don't have dried tamarind then use packaged or bottled tamarind paste.</li>
            <li>Mix well.</li>
            <li>Next add 1 to 1.5 tablespoons Sambar Powder. At this step you can also add ½ to 1 teaspoon of jaggery powder. Adding jaggery is optional.</li>
            <li>Stir and mix well again.</li>
            <li>Add the mashed dal.</li>
            <li>Stir and mix very well. If the consistency looks very thick, you can add some water.</li>
            <li>Simmer on a medium-low heat till it comes to a boil. Stir at intervals. You will see a frothy layer on top when the sambar begins boiling.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>4. Temper</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> In a small pan or tadka pan, heat 2 tablespoons gingelly oil (oil made from raw sesame seeds).</li>
            <li>Let the mustard seeds crackle on low heat.</li>
            <li>Then add 1 to 2 dry red chillies (halved and seeds removed).</li>
            <li>Immediately add 10 to 12 curry leaves, 5 to 6 fenugreek seeds (methi seeds) and 2 pinches of asafoetida (hing). Be careful while adding curry leaves as the oil splutters a lot.</li>
            <li>Fry them till the red chilies change color and curry leaves become crisp on low heat. Take care that you don't burn the spices.</li>
            <li>Immediately add this tempering mixture in the hot sambar.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with its lid for 4 to 5 minutes, so that the aroma and flavors from the tempering mixture get infused with the sambar.</li>
            <li>Serve sambar hot or warm. Garnish with some coriander leaves if you prefer. Usually, it is is cooked a two-three hours earlier as its taste becomes better with time.</li>
        </ol>
